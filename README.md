I have sent the github url to you , you have to only open the link and click on code and copied it.
after that use command (git clone and paste the githhub url) after that open terminal and write command (cd micro-quiz-platform)
then to run locally on computer use (npm run dev) command.


I think this app is used for Children so i take light colour theme to create this app. I use create app command and for creation i face problem during retrival of data from backend and folder structure. and with the help of cursor ai i fix some state , responsiveness problem.


copy git url  ---->  open terminal ----> write command  (git clone copied git url)  ----> open project on vs code ----->  open terminal and run command ----> ( example --  Desktop\Micro_Quiz\> cd micro-quiz-platform) ------> to run locally use this command -----> (example --> Desktop\Micro_Quiz\micro-quiz-platform> npm run dev )
